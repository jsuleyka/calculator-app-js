# Frontend Mentor - Calculator app

![Design preview for the Calculator app coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge. This challenge was created using HTML, CSS(Flexbox) and Vanilla JavaScript.

## The challenge

The challenge is to build out this calculator app and get it looking as close to the design as possible, perform mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division; adjusting the color theme based on their preference.

## Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JavaScript

## What I learned

In this challenge, I improve my coding skills for the Vanilla JS handling setAttribute events adding and removing classes and I learned to adjust the color theme based on a triple switch.

```js
 body.className = 'theme2';
 ....
  sum.setAttribute('disabled', '');
  ....
```
